Aim of the project is to make embedded CNC controller based on EMC2 software. It based on the widely avaliable mini2440 platform: ARM920T CPU running at 400 MHz, 64Mb of SDRAM and 128Mb-1Gb of NAND flash, SD/MMC card, USB Host 1.1. Project utilize Linux kernel version 2.6.35.9 with i-pipe and Xenomia support, and hard realtime task based on Fast Interrupt handling from periodic timer. It has no display and touchscreen, but it has embedded WEB server instead.

The project has been suspended because of new version of LinuxCNC in developers branch that is able to run on BeagleBone Black board http://blog.machinekit.io/
Then miniEMC2's WEB-server is available there.
